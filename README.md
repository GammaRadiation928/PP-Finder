# PP-Finder
Finds all Palindromic Primes (PPs) when inputted m and n where m is smaller than n. It will then output how many there are along with the first 3 and last 3 within the range.
So far I've gotten it to find all PPs between one (1) and one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) within 5 minutes.

I've made this piece of code for my university coursework where one of our test cases has us find all PPs between one and one trillion within an hour.
